# Debug, a Pest-Classifierüêû
## Inspiration
Farmers rely heavily on crop yields as their main source of income. However, many pests can get in the way of optimal production yields as they can eat and harm the field crops. Pesticides are commonly used by many farmers in order to get rid of them. However, large quantities of pesticides can be expensive, and many times, farmers misuse pesticides on the wrong pests and thus waste money, time, and resources. Overused pesticides can cause pesticide drift. The EPA estimates up to 70 million pounds of pesticides are lost to drift each year.

## What it does
This is where the Debug application comes into play. Using Debug, farmers are able to upload a picture of a recurrent pest they observe in their fields. Once uploaded, they are provided with a brief summary on whether the pest is harmful or not, and some potential pesticides they could use. This way, the farmers will be able to save a substantial amount of money, closing into hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year.
