# Debug, a Pest-Classifierüêû
![GitHub Logo](img/DebugLogo.png)
## Inspiration
Farmers rely heavily on crop yields as their main source of income. However, many pests can get in the way of optimal production yields as they can eat and harm the field crops. Pesticides are commonly used by many farmers in order to get rid of them. However, large quantities of pesticides can be expensive, and many times, farmers misuse pesticides on the wrong pests. The overuse of pesticides has many consequences **which can cost farmers money, time, and resources:**
-  First, the EPA estimates up to **70 million pounds of pesticides are lost to drift each year**, a common issue in which extra pesticide chemicals are carried by the wind, hurting the ecosystems, the farmer's wallet, and human health.
- Second, an overabundance of pesticides on the wrong species can lead to **pesticide resistance**. As a result, pesticide costs should be expected to increase as new variations of the pesticide are more expensive. 
- Third, **spraying pesticides on beneficial pests** can negatively impact the production rate of the farmer's crops, which is a waste of money. 


## What it does
This is where the Debug application comes into play. Using Debug, farmers are able to upload a picture of a recurrent pest they observe in their fields. Once uploaded, they are provided with a brief summary on whether the pest is harmful or not, and some potential pesticides they could use. This way, the farmers will be able to save a substantial amount of money, closing into hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year.
